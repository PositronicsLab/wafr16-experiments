1. File list

filename			description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
build-test-plugin.sh            Bash script for building the plugin
hist.py				Python matplotlib script for producing a
                                  histogram of conservative advancement steps
multibody-with-prismatic.xml	100m, 100 link chain with prismatic joints
multibody.xml			100m, 100 link chain
pendulum.xml			Simple pendulum for trivial conservative
				  advancement checks
README                          (this file)
test.cpp			Moby plugin for testing conservative 
				  advancement bounds on a multibody

2. Running the experiments:

   First, build the plugin by running build-test-plugin.sh- you'll likely
   need to edit this file for it to run correctly on your system. 

   For the chain (for producing the histogram):
   
   $ moby-driver -mt=5 -l=3 multibody.xml 2> /tmp/out

   For the chain with prismatic joints (conservative advancement stress test):

   $ moby-driver -p=./libtest.so multibody-with-prismatic.xml 2> /tmp/dist


3. Extracting data

   The output from the chain with prismatic joints ('/tmp/dist') will be a 
   series of distance measurements. Some other text output to stderr may be 
   present in this file and will need to be removed before loading the file
   into, e.g., GNU Octave.
