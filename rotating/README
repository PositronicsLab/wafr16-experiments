2. Running the experiment

First, build the plugin by running build-rbox-plugins.sh- you'll likely need
to edit this file for it to run correctly on your system.

  $ moby-driver -mt=10 -l=3 -p=./librbox-plugin-adaptive.so adaptive.xml 2> out

3. Extracting data

Multiple types of data will be output. The simulation time can be extracted
by:

  $ grep "mini_step" out > sim.steps

The signed distances over time can be extracted by:

  $ grep "signed distance" out > dist

We used regex search and replace in vim to extract the simulation time
and signed distances from the grep outputs.
 
The times that the contact manifold changes are output automatically to
manifold.change. No further processing need be done.
